Phishing Email Analysis Report
Subject: GRANT
This email claims the recipient is eligible for a £100,000.00 grant and instructs them to contact a representative using a non-official email address and phone number. The message impersonates the United Nations (UN) and uses formal-sounding names to appear credible. It follows a classic advance-fee scam/phishing pattern designed to collect personal details and potentially extort money or data.

E-mail Analysis
Header Analysis
From: familiesgrant@gmail.com
 A generic Gmail address — not affiliated with any known organization, and clearly not from an official domain. The sender name “U N” is also vague and unprofessional.


Return-Path: sangdeptrai84@gmail.com
 The return path does not match the From address, indicating possible spoofing or sender redirection — a common tactic in phishing campaigns.


Originating IP: 209.85.220.41
 While the IP is part of Google’s email infrastructure (mail-sor-f41.google.com), this does not guarantee safety. Gmail is often abused for phishing due to its reputation.


Reverse DNS (rDNS): mail-sor-f41.google.com
 This is a valid reverse DNS for a Gmail server. However, phishers often use legitimate services to bypass filters, so this is not a sign of legitimacy on its own.


Content Analysis
Subject: GRANT
Message Body:
Greetings Dear,
Send your Ref: FSG2025 / Name / Phone Number / Country to Mr. Andrej Mahecic on un.grant@socialworker.net, +1 888 673 0430 for your £100,000.00.
Sincerely
Mr. C. Gunness
 On behalf of the UN.
Analysis of Body Content:
Grammar and Phrasing Issues:


“Greetings Dear” is a non-standard and awkward salutation.


Vague instructions with no explanation of source or reason for the grant.


Poor punctuation, odd formatting, and general lack of professionalism.


Impersonation:


References to UN staff (Mr. C. Gunness, Mr. Andrej Mahecic), both of whom are real former spokespersons for the UN. This is a social engineering tactic to appear credible.


Email used for contact: un.grant@socialworker.net — not a UN domain (UN official domains end in .int, e.g., @un.org or @unodc.org). The domain socialworker.net is completely unrelated.


Urgency and Emotional Bait:


A large amount of money (£100,000.00) is promised for doing almost nothing — a classic lure for advance-fee fraud.


Social engineering attempt to hook victims with hope and greed.


Request for Personal Info:


Ref number, name, phone number, country — typical information gathered to begin a longer scam chain.



Attachment / Link Analysis
Attachment: None


Links: None


Behavioral Concern: Instead of a link, the scam prompts users to email or call a fraudulent contact — often used to bypass link-based security filters.


Behavior and Visual Tactics
Identity Theft: Impersonates high-level UN representatives.


Phishing via Contact: Encourages victim-initiated contact, which leads to more targeted exploitation (e.g., requests for identity documents or “processing fees”).


Deceptive Simplicity: Clean and short message avoids detection, but builds the foundation for a highly manipulative fraud scheme.


Conclusion
This email is a high-risk phishing and fraud attempt, based on:
Spoofed identity of UN officials


Unverified and unrelated domains


Emotional and financial bait


Redirection to fraudulent communication channels


Use of real names to build trust


Final Verdict: MALICIOUS EMAIL
Key Red Flags:
 Free Gmail sender (no official domain)


Vague and awkward language


Real UN names used to build false credibility

 Unofficial and unrelated contact domain (socialworker.net)


Request for personal info and direct contact


 Impersonation of a well-known global institution
